## Original Artifact
### Binary Search Tree
The binary search tree program was created in CS-300 Data Structures & Algorithms in June of 2024  
It implements a user menu for the user to choose to load a .csv file (either with a command line prompt, or default to the file included)  
Then the algorithm sorts the file by row in the Parser class, and inserts each row into the binary search tree as a course object.
